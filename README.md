Hi, Iâ€™m Ankush Lakhani ðŸ‘¾ ðŸ¤–
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find resources and projects related to cybersecurity and web development. These tools and techniques are powerful, so please use them responsibly. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing on private networks, as unauthorized activities may lead to legal consequences.

In addition to cybersecurity tools, Iâ€™ve also shared web development projects showcasing my work with various frameworks. I hope you find these projects insightful and inspiring for your own learning and development.

Note: Safety and ethical practices are key. A fire exit should never be blockedâ€”whether in real life or in the digital world.
